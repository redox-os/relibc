# implementation of sigsetjmp

All code found in the subdirectories of this directory belong to [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/). They own it. All rights go to them.
Currently only x86_64 is supported, because I don't have access to non-x86 devices to test it properly.
Converted to Intel assembly syntax, according to setjmp and longjmp found in setjmp header.
