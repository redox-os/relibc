/// A specialized [`Result`](../result/enum.Result.html) type for I/O
/// operations.
///
/// This type is broadly used across [`std::io`] for any operation which may
/// produce an error.
///
/// This typedef is generally used to avoid writing out [`io::Error`] directly and
/// is otherwise a direct mapping to [`Result`].
///
/// While usual Rust style is to import types directly, aliases of [`Result`]
/// often are not, to make it easier to distinguish between them. [`Result`] is
/// generally assumed to be [`std::result::Result`][`Result`], and so users of this alias
/// will generally use `io::Result` instead of shadowing the prelude's import
/// of [`std::result::Result`][`Result`].
///
/// [`std::io`]: ../io/index.html
/// [`io::Error`]: ../io/struct.Error.html
/// [`Result`]: ../result/enum.Result.html
///
/// # Examples
///
/// A convenience function that bubbles an `io::Result` to its caller:
///
/// ```
/// use std::io;
///
/// fn get_string() -> io::Result<String> {
///     let mut buffer = String::new();
///
///     io::stdin().read_line(&mut buffer)?;
///
///     Ok(buffer)
/// }
/// ```

/// [`ErrorKind`].
