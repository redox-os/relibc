# relibc

relibc is a portable POSIX C standard library written in Rust. It is under heavy development, and currently supports Redox and Linux.

The motivation for this project is twofold: Reduce issues that the Redox developers were having with [newlib](https://sourceware.org/newlib/), and create a safer alternative to a C standard library written in C. It is mainly designed to be used under Redox, as an alternative to newlib, but it also supports Linux system calls via the [sc](https://crates.io/crates/sc) crate.

### Repository Layout

- `include` - Header files (mostly macros and variadic functions `cbindgen` can't generate)
- `src` - Source files
- `src/c` - C code
- `src/crt0` - Runtime code
- `src/crti` - Runtime code
- `src/crtn` - Runtime code
- `src/header` - Header files implementation
- `src/header/*` - Each folder has a `cbindgen.toml` file, it generates a C-to-Rust interface and header files
- `src/ld_so` - Dynamic loader code
- `src/platform` - Platform-specific and common code
- `src/platform/redox` - Redox-specific code
- `src/platform/linux` - Linux-specific code
- `src/pthread` - pthread implementation
- `src/sync` - Synchronization primitives
- `tests` - C tests (each MR needs to give success in all of them)

### Build On The Build System

Inside of your Redox build system, run:

```sh
make prefix
```

(It only works if the timestamp of the `relibc` folder changed)

### Issues

#### I'm building for my own platform which I run, and am getting `x86_64-linux-gnu-ar: command not found` (or similar)

The Makefile expects GNU compiler tools prefixed with the platform specifier, as would be present when you installed a cross compiler. Since you are building for your own platform, some Linux distributions (like Manjaro) don't install/symlink the prefixed executables.

An easy fix would be to replace the corresponding lines in the Makefile, e.g.

```diff
 ifeq ($(TARGET),x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)
        export CC=x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc
-       export LD=x86_64-linux-gnu-ld
-       export AR=x86_64-linux-gnu-ar
+       export LD=ld
+       export AR=ar
        export OBJCOPY=x86_64-linux-gnu-objcopy
 endif
```
